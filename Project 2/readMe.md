This project uses Qt to implement an interactable grade calculator. The user can choose from two options for grading schemes, PIC 10C and Math 131BH, and then enter points received as well as the total points for the project. The calculator will then output the overall grade for the class. The calculator also comes with a reset button for easy reuse. 

Five Files: 
main.cpp (our main file that creates the widget window)
grade_calculator.h (the header file for our grade calculator)
grade_calculator.cpp (the cpp file for our grade_calculator)
grade_calculator.ui (the file that controls how the grade calculator looks)
